==========

###Raphael-based 3D micro-library

Origami generates 2D vector images that are projections of 3D objects defined by flat surfaces (thus: origami). Origami is very lightweight and works on browsers that don't support HTML5 CANVAS tags.

For really advanced 3D in Javascript, see [Three.js](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/). 

###Dependencies

Uses [RaphaÃ«l](raphaeljs.com) for rendering SVG/VML.

###Usage:

	origami = new Origami("paperplane", 90, 60);

	function paperplane(scale){
		scale=scale || 0.4;
		var midspan = 20*scale;
		var depth = 20*scale;
		var length= 70*scale;
		var wingspan = 100*scale;
		origami.face({x: -wingspan, y:-length, z:depth},
		            {x: -midspan, y:-length, z:depth},
		            {x:0, y:length, z:depth},200); 
		origami.face({x: wingspan, y:-length, z:depth},
		            {x:0, y:length, z:depth},
		            {x:midspan, y:-length, z:depth},200);
		origami.face({x: -midspan, y:-length, z:depth},
		            {x:0, y:length, z:depth},
		            {x:0, y:-length, z:-depth},200); 
		origami.face({x: midspan, y:-length, z:depth},
		            {x:0, y:-length, z:-depth},
		            {x:0, y:length, z:depth},200); 
	}
	
	origami.camera.setAngles(1.0,-2.5);
	origami.camera.cull = false;
	paperplane();

###TODO: 

- quad faces,
- lines, points
- light position (currently: the camera is the light source)
- objects - grouped faces
- a real documentation
